## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `gworkspace` `[[tool_registry.endpoints]]` in the bundled default config now
  ships `enabled = true` (was `false`, "pending auth"). `rpc.discover` on the
  `trusty-gworkspace-mcp` server is a pure static function that never touches
  the token store, so eager discovery at harness startup always succeeds
  regardless of auth state; unauthenticated tool calls fail with a clear
  "run setup" operational error instead of a startup crash. Authenticate with
  `trusty-gworkspace-mcp setup` to actually light up Gmail/Calendar/Drive
  access for the Assistant (Phase 1 of the Assistant epic #3052, part of
  [#3056](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3056))

### Fixed

- `tmux::orchestrator::TmuxOrchestrator::create_session` and `debugger::tmux::TmuxAdapter::create_session` now apply generous tmux scrollback (`history-limit=100000`) and mouse-wheel scrolling BEFORE `new-session`, via the new shared `trusty_common::tmux` layer — this crate previously ran its own independent tmux implementation with no scrollback handling at all, so every trusty-agents-hosted tmux session (including the debug REPL) was stuck at tmux's tiny 2000-line default even after trusty-mpm's #2398/#2399 fix landed (closes [#3004](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3004), refs #2398, #2399)
- migrate off archived/unsound `serde_yml` (GHSA-hhw4-xg65-fp2x) and its transitive `libyml` (GHSA-gfxp-f68g-8x78) onto the workspace-blessed `serde_yaml` 0.9, closing Dependabot alerts #42/#43 (closes [#2991](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2991))
- bump `lru` 0.12 → 0.16, fixing RUSTSEC-2026-0002 (`IterMut` violates Stacked Borrows, GHSA-rhfx-m35p-ff5j); no call-site changes needed ([#2782](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2782)) ([`e62b454`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/e62b4540d39c5a442d05e849197157932f37e664))
