## [Unreleased]

### Added

- new bundled base `assistant` agent (`.trusty-agents/agents/assistant/`) — a reusable, **nameless** personal-productivity template derived from the "Izzie" prototype: functional `role = "assistant"`, the curated Google Workspace tool surface, `memory.read`/`memory.write`/`search.read` scopes plus **read-only** `google.read` (§5.5 — a generic template does not mutate a user's Google data by default), and generic helpful/productivity instructions, with NO persona name, user-identity binding, or user-specific skills. Persona identity is contributed by a user's `extends = "assistant"` personalization overlay (Eve §2.5.1). Izzie is now shipped as the reference overlay example (`.trusty-agents/agents/izzie/`): `extends = "assistant"` + personal deltas (display name, personal skills, Masa-bound persona) and an explicit opt-in to Google **write** (`google.*`). The `extends` inheritance resolver lands in [#3055](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3055); until then the overlay carries the curated `[tools]` allowlist/scopes and the safety-critical persona guardrails (approval-framing, anti-hallucination) redundantly so it is safe standalone, and the working Izzie the REPL/Telegram persona paths load remains the standalone `izzie.toml` (closes [#3054](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3054), refs #3052, #3055)

- `extends:`-based agent personalization (DOC-41 §2.5 / §2.5.1, epic #3052): a user can now personalize a stock/bundled base agent — name it, add tools, override tone — without forking it, by authoring a child agent (e.g. `~/.trusty-agents/agents/my-assistant.md`) that declares `extends: <base>` and layers personal deltas on top. The previously-inert `extends:` frontmatter key is now live. Resolution mirrors trusty-mpm's proven `compose_agent` exactly (same `MAX_DEPTH = 8`, case-insensitive base lookup, base-first prose concatenation) and runs once at load time — reachable from BOTH the informational `AgentRegistry::load` AND the real dispatch loaders `AgentConfig::by_name`/`by_name_async` (a flat `<name>.md` overlay tier was added to both so a personalization overlay actually dispatches, not just shows in the roster) — never per dispatch. Merge follows the §2.5 table: scalars (`model`, `display_name`, `role`, `description`, plus `runner` and opt-in `persistent_session`) child-overrides-parent; list fields (`tools.allowed`, `tools.scopes`, `system_prompt.skills`, `capabilities`) union (dedup, base-first); persona/instruction prose concatenates base-first; `llm`/`compress`/`session`/`plugins`/`rbac` inherit from the base wholesale. Cycles, missing parents, and over-deep chains fail with a clear `AgentExtendsError`; in the registry a failed resolution keeps the unresolved agent but surfaces the breakage in the roster / `tagent agents list` (new `AgentSummary::extends_error`). A directory package whose `extends` can't be resolved no longer silently shadows a complete flat `<name>.toml` — the loader falls back to the flat file with a warn. Case-only duplicate agent names are rejected at load (they broke case-insensitive resolution). `.md` agent frontmatter now also parses `tools:` and `display_name:` so a personalization overlay's declared tools actually union with the base's (closes [#3055](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3055))

### Changed

- `gworkspace` `[[tool_registry.endpoints]]` in the bundled default config now
  ships `enabled = true` (was `false`, "pending auth"). `rpc.discover` on the
  `trusty-gworkspace-mcp` server is a pure static function that never touches
  the token store, so eager discovery at harness startup always succeeds
  regardless of auth state; unauthenticated tool calls fail with a clear
  "run setup" operational error instead of a startup crash. Authenticate with
  `trusty-gworkspace-mcp setup` to actually light up Gmail/Calendar/Drive
  access for the Assistant (Phase 1 of the Assistant epic #3052, part of
  [#3056](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3056))

### Fixed

- `tmux::orchestrator::TmuxOrchestrator::create_session` and `debugger::tmux::TmuxAdapter::create_session` now apply generous tmux scrollback (`history-limit=100000`) and mouse-wheel scrolling BEFORE `new-session`, via the new shared `trusty_common::tmux` layer — this crate previously ran its own independent tmux implementation with no scrollback handling at all, so every trusty-agents-hosted tmux session (including the debug REPL) was stuck at tmux's tiny 2000-line default even after trusty-mpm's #2398/#2399 fix landed (closes [#3004](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3004), refs #2398, #2399)
- migrate off archived/unsound `serde_yml` (GHSA-hhw4-xg65-fp2x) and its transitive `libyml` (GHSA-gfxp-f68g-8x78) onto the workspace-blessed `serde_yaml` 0.9, closing Dependabot alerts #42/#43 (closes [#2991](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2991))
- bump `lru` 0.12 → 0.16, fixing RUSTSEC-2026-0002 (`IterMut` violates Stacked Borrows, GHSA-rhfx-m35p-ff5j); no call-site changes needed ([#2782](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2782)) ([`e62b454`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/e62b4540d39c5a442d05e849197157932f37e664))
