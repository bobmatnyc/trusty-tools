## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial scaffold: Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 desktop shell for the `trusty-code`
  (tcode) daemon, mirroring `crates/trusty-mpm-gui`'s structure (refs #2983,
  `docs/specs/trusty-code-harness-ui.md`). A single `get_daemon_url` IPC
  command exposes the configured daemon base URL (`TRUSTY_CODE_URL`, default
  `http://127.0.0.1:7881`); all daemon data (starting with `GET /health`) is
  fetched directly from the frontend via `fetch()`, never proxied through
  Rust, per DOC-39 §2.1's thin-client rule. Minimal working shell only — the
  full DOC-39 screens land in later slices as the REST gateway (#2983) adds
  routes.
