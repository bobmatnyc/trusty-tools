## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Letter-grade PR reviews (#732)** — the reviewer LLM now assigns a letter
  grade (A+ through F, 13 half-steps) to every review, and the verdict is
  derived from it per a fixed product mapping (APPROVE floor = B-):

  | Grade band           | Verdict         |
  |----------------------|-----------------|
  | A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- | APPROVE          |
  | C+, C, C-            | APPROVE*         |
  | D+, D, D-            | REQUEST_CHANGES  |
  | F                    | BLOCK            |

  The final verdict is `max(grade_verdict, severity_floor(findings))` so the
  grade never produces a verdict weaker than what the severity floor requires.

- **Grade → verdict reconciliation with verification** — after the adversarial
  verifier (Phase 2, #583) re-derives the verdict, the grade is clamped via
  `clamp_grade_to_verdict` so grade and verdict never disagree in the output.

- **Grade in structured output** — `ReviewResult` gains a `grade: Option<String>`
  field (serde: `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`); the MCP `review_pr`
  JSON output includes it alongside the verdict.

- **Grade in the review footer** — the posted PR comment footer now reads:
  `Grade: B+ · 🤖 Reviewed by \`model\` · tokens ↑N ↓M · est. $X`

- **Boundary unit tests** — `grade_b_minus_yields_approve`,
  `grade_c_plus/c_minus_yields_approve_star`,
  `grade_d_plus/d_minus_yields_request_changes`, `grade_f_yields_block`,
  plus `derive_verdict_with_grade_severity_overrides_grade_a` (confirmed High
  finding clamps a model "A" grade to F), and `body_footer_contains_grade`
  (pins the exact footer string).

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Adversarial verifier calibration — fixes 100% refutation rate** (#726)

  Three root causes were identified and fixed together:

  1. **Token truncation (root cause):** The verifier role's `default_max_tokens`
     was `16`, which is too small to hold a complete `{"judgment":"CONFIRMED","reason":"…"}`
     JSON object. Bedrock truncated the response mid-JSON, making it unparseable,
     which triggered a conservative refutation on every call.  Bumped to `128`.
     The module-level fallback constant `VERIFY_MAX_TOKENS` was also raised from
     `64` to `128` for consistency.

  2. **Biased burden-of-proof prompt:** The verifier system prompt contained
     "The default answer is REFUTED. When in doubt, REFUTE." — a strong default
     that compounded the truncation problem.  Replaced with a symmetric,
     evidence-weighing instruction that asks the model to decide on the actual diff
     content without defaulting to either verdict.  The truncation/hallucination
     hard rule (REFUTE anything referencing a file/line absent from the diff) is
     preserved unchanged.

  3. **Verdict collapse on non-clean refutations:** Unparseable/truncated verifier
     responses were mapped to plain `VerifyOutcome::Refuted`, indistinguishable
     from a clean model REFUTED.  `rederive_verdict` then treated all-refuted
     rounds as "escalation rested on refuted evidence" and dropped the verdict to
     `APPROVE`.  Two fixes:
     - Unparseable responses are now mapped to the distinct `TruncationRefuted`
       variant (already present in `VerifyOutcome`), separating infrastructure
       failures from clean model judgments.
     - `rederive_verdict` uses a three-way baseline rule: (a) any confirmed →
       keep `primary_verdict`; (b) at least one clean model REFUTED → drop to
       `APPROVE`; (c) all demotions were `TruncationRefuted`/`ErrorRefuted` →
       preserve `primary_verdict` (verifier infra failed, not the reviewer's
       reasoning).

  **Regression fixture:** `verify_join_handle_regression_pr720` models the
  dropped-`JoinHandle` finding from PR #720 (the true-positive that was wrongly
  refuted in the original incident).  Asserts that (a) a CONFIRMED judgment
  preserves the finding, and (b) a truncated judgment does NOT collapse the
  verdict to APPROVE.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Model + token-usage footer on posted reviews** (#728) — every posted PR review
  comment now includes a metadata footer with the reviewer model slug, input/output
  token counts, and cost estimate (e.g., `🤖 Reviewed by us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 · tokens ↑1234 ↓567 · est. $0.01`).
  Single-source-of-truth with the `ReviewResult` struct fields; appears identically in dry-run output.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Required-dependency health gating** (#722) — `review_health` now reports
  `status: degraded` only when a *required* dependency (trusty-search) is unreachable.
  Non-required dependencies (trusty-analyze) being unavailable does NOT degrade status.
  Centralized `compute_status` logic shared by HTTP + MCP paths.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Inference reachability probe in health endpoint** (#719) — `review_health` now
  includes an `inference` field (`ok` | `unreachable` | `auth_error` | `unknown`),
  always-on with 10s TTL and 3s timeout. Covers Bedrock + OpenRouter availability.
  When inference != ok, service status is degraded.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Map-reduce review Phase 1: config + selector** (#690) — structured
  map-reduce review pipeline with per-file configuration and selector logic
  to route files to the appropriate review strategy.

- **Map-reduce review Phase 2: per-file diff splitter** (#698) — per-file
  diff splitter that partitions large diffs into reviewable chunks, enabling
  reviews on PRs that exceed the single-pass diff cap.

- **Auto-derive search index from repo root** (#661) — the reviewer now
  auto-detects the trusty-search index ID from the repository root path,
  eliminating manual index configuration for standard installations.

- **Daemon http_addr discovery + auto-detect** (#665/#676) — the review
  daemon discovers the trusty-search HTTP address automatically via the
  port-lock file; manual `--search-url` override still supported.

- **list_indexes envelope parse + resolve_index wiring** (#672/#670) —
  MCP tool `list_indexes` correctly parses the response envelope and
  `resolve_index` is wired into the review pipeline.

- **GitHub Issues query cap 256 chars** (#675) — GitHub Issues search
  queries are now capped at 256 characters to stay within API limits.

- **BrokenPipe on stdin treated non-fatal** (#702) — a broken pipe on
  the MCP stdio transport is treated as a clean client disconnect rather
  than a crash, improving robustness in CI and pipe-based invocations.

- **redb 4.x dedup store recovery** (#702) — the dedup claim store is
  upgraded to redb 4.x with graceful incompatible-file recovery: existing
  redb 2.x `dedup.redb` is backed up and recreated automatically.

> **OPERATOR NOTE:** Existing `dedup.redb` is backed up to
> `dedup.redb.v2-incompatible` and recreated on first start after upgrade.
> The dedup store only tracks posted reviews (SHA-keyed claim locks), not
> review history or results — no review content is lost.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Initial release: LLM-backed PR-review service with GitHub App auth,
  MCP stdio JSON-RPC service, diff analysis with noise filtering,
  context orchestration, and dedup claim store.
