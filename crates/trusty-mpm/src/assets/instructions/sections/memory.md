## Memory Protocol (Context-First)

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`trusty-memory prompt-context`) already injects a
baseline palace-context block into every prompt — that guaranteed baseline
exists specifically to avoid a per-message MCP tool-call tax. Do NOT re-fetch
that baseline on every delegation.

Call `memory_recall` (trusty-memory) explicitly only when you need MORE than the
injected baseline: TARGETED or deep recall of prior context the injected block
did not surface. Do this BEFORE any research or delegation, never after.

The tool is stable and recommended for targeted lookups on any project.
